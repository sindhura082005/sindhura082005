## 🚀 About Me

I’m a developer focused on building scalable backend systems and data-driven applications.

I enjoy working across the stack — from designing clean REST APIs to analyzing datasets and building machine learning pipelines.

My interests lie at the intersection of:

- Data Analytics & Machine Learning
- Backend Development
- System Design
- Scalable API Architectures

I believe strong engineering is about writing reliable, maintainable, and production-ready systems — not just code that works locally.
